-  It is important to distinguish between stakeholders and users
- Don't rule out NRT update; it could be a useful evolution
- Access to data is not the main issue; the problem is the authoritativeness
and the trust level
- Don't try to second guess user understanding: energy sector have often a
better understanding of the current climate than most of us haveâ€¦
- Why don't you work on embedding climate indices services into other apps
