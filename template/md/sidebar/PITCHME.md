-  The work on homogenisation and QC is excellent and important
- The same is true for the work on the indices (e.g. WP4 & WP5)
- The CS proposition is less clear & compelling
- It will be important to discuss how this could feed into the [C3S](http://climate.copernicus.eu)

- Access to data is not the main issue (authoritativeness and the trust)
-  It's essential to distinguish between stakeholders and users
- Don't rule out NRT update; it could be a useful evolution

- What is the long term sustainability of the indecis website-s?
- Governance: What role do users play in the shaping of the project?
- Why don't you work on embedding climate indices services into other apps?
- How are you planning (if at all) to interface with C3S_512_EQC4CDS led by BSC?

- Push even further the role of the users
- Engage direclty with [C3S](http://climate.copernicus.eu) (Seasonal, Cordex,..)
- Publish the algorithms for indices and make them "tools" on the [CDS](http://cds.climate.copernicus.eu)
- This would allow the software to be used on other datasets + API

I am clearly biased on this topic as I have a vested interest....

- Change the conversation with the users; it's not about you, it's about them
- From "what CS can do for you" to "what keeps you awake at night"
- You developed no one but two impressive websites
- but why should the users come to it?
- Collect the data on the users preference and traffic
