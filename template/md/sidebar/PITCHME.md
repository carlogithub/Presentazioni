-  The work on homogenisation and QC is excellent and important
- It will be important to discuss how this could feed into the [C3S](http://climate.copernicus.eu)
- The same is true for the work of WP4 on the indices
- The CS proposition is less clear & compelling

-  It's essential to distinguish between stakeholders and users
- Don't rule out NRT update; it could be a useful evolution
- Access to data is not the main issue (authoritativeness and the trust)
- Don't try to second guess user understanding of climate

- What is the long term sustainability of the indecis website?
- Why have you started from the data rather than from the users?
- Governance: What role do users play in the shaping of the project?
- Why don't you work on embedding climate indices services into other apps?

@ol
- Engage direclty with [C3S](http://climate.copernicus.eu)
- Publish the algorithms for indices and make them "tools" on the [CDS](http://cds.climate.copernicus.eu)
- This would allow the software to be used on other datasets

I am clearly biased on this topic as I have a vested interest....
